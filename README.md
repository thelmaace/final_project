Report on Water Quality Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Introduction
This report presents the results of a machine learning classification task aimed at predicting the potability of water based on various water quality parameters. The dataset contains information on several attributes of water samples, including pH, hardness, solids concentration, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and potability.
Data Source
The data was collected from https://github.com/MainakRepositor/Datasets/blob/master/water_potability.csv

Dataset Description
•	pH: The measure of how acidic or basic the water is.
•	Hardness: The concentration of minerals, mainly calcium and magnesium, in the water.
•	Solids: The total dissolved solids in the water.
•	Chloramines: The concentration of chloramines in the water, which are disinfectants.
•	Sulfate: The concentration of sulfate compounds in the water.
•	Conductivity: The water's ability to conduct electricity, which is influenced by dissolved ions.
•	Organic Carbon: The concentration of organic carbon compounds in the water.
•	Trihalomethanes: The concentration of trihalomethanes, which are disinfection byproducts.
•	Turbidity: The clarity of the water, affected by suspended particles.
•	Potability: The target variable indicating whether the water is suitable for human consumption (1 for potable, 0 for non-potable).
Summary Statistics
•	The dataset consists of 3276 samples.
•	The mean values, standard deviations, minimum, 25th percentile, 50th percentile (median), 75th percentile, and maximum values are provided for each attribute.
•	Potability of water: 39.01% of the samples are classified as potable (1).
Machine Learning Method
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is employed for classification. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.
Model Training
The SVM model is trained using the labeled dataset. The input features (X_train) are the water quality attributes, and the target variable (y_train) is the potability label.
Conclusion
The trained SVM model aims to predict whether water is potable based on its quality attributes. By analyzing the provided dataset and employing the SVM classifier, we can make informed decisions about water quality and its suitability for human consumption. Further evaluation of the model's performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score would provide deeper insights into its effectiveness and generalization capabilities.
